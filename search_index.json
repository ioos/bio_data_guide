[["index.html", "Darwin Core Guide Preface", " Darwin Core Guide Standardizing Marine Biological Data Working Group 2022-03-10 Preface Biological data structures, definitions, measurements, and linkages are neccessarily as diverse as the systems they represent. This presents a real challenge when integrating data across biological research domains such as ecology, oceanography, fisheries, and climate sciences. Lots of standards exist for use with biological data but navigating them can be difficult for data managers who are new to them. The Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) Biological Data Standards Cluster developed this primer for managers of biological data to provide a quick, easy resource for navigating a selection of the standards that exist. The goal of the primer is to spread awareness about existing standards and is intended to be shared online and at conferences to increase the adoption of standards for biological data and make them FAIR.

Transforming and integrating data is about combining the right standards for your desired interoperability with other data types. For example, interoperating fish biology measurements with climate level variables. There are a few concepts necessary to make this possible such as standard data structures, controlled vocabularies and knowledge representations, along with metadata standards to facilitate data discovery. This will permit the inclusion of more data and broader access to better ecosystem based models. Many scientific domains data handling practices are currently being reshaped in light of recent advances in computing power, technology, and data science.

Taxonomy was processed using a separate script (TPWD_Taxonomy.R) using a taxa list pulled from the pdf “2009 Resource Monitoring Operations Manual”. All original data, processed data and scripts are stored on an item in USGS ScienceBase. # Load some of the libraries library(reshape2) library(tidyverse) library(readr) # Load the data BagSeine &lt;- read.csv(&quot;https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/53a887f4e4b075096c60cfdd?f=__disk__6e%2F6a%2F67%2F6e6a678c41cf928e025fd30339789cc8b893a815&amp;allowOpen=true&quot;, stringsAsFactors=FALSE, strip.white = TRUE) Note that if not already done you’ll need to run the TPWD_Taxonomy.R script to get the taxaList file squared away or load the taxonomy file to the World Register of Marine Species Taxon Match Tool https://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=match 2.1.2 Event file To start we will create the Darwin Core Event file. This is the file that will have all the information about the sampling event such as date, location, depth, sampling protocol. Basically anything about the cruise or the way the sampling was done will go in this file. You can see all the Darwin Core terms that are part of the event file here http://tools.gbif.org/dwca-validator/extension.do?id=dwc:Event. The original format for these TPWD HARC files has all of the information associated as the event in the first approximately 50 columns and then all of the information about the occurrence (species) as columns for each species. We will need to start by limiting to the event information only. event &lt;- BagSeine[,1:47] Next there are several pieces of information that need 1) to be added like the geodeticDatum 2) to be pieced together from multiple columns like datasetID or 3) minor changes like the minimum and maximum depth. event &lt;- event %&gt;% mutate(type = &quot;Event&quot;, modified = lubridate::today(), language = &quot;en&quot;, license = &quot;http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode&quot;, institutionCode = &quot;TPWD&quot;, ownerInstitutionCode = &quot;HARC&quot;, coordinateUncertaintyInMeters = &quot;100&quot;, geodeticDatum = &quot;WGS84&quot;, georeferenceProtocol = &quot;Handheld GPS&quot;, country = &quot;United States&quot;, countryCode = &quot;US&quot;, stateProvince = &quot;Texas&quot;, datasetID = gsub(&quot;

for (i in 1:nrow(event)){ event[i,]$samplingEffort &lt;- abs(lubridate::as.duration(event[i,]$CompDate - event[i,]$StartDate)) } event$samplingEffort &lt;- paste(event$samplingEffort, &quot;seconds&quot;, sep = &quot; &quot;) Finally there were a few columns that were a direct match to a Darwin Core term and therefore just need to be renamed to follow the standard. event &lt;- event %&gt;% rename(samplingProtocol = Gear_Type, locality = Estuary, waterBody = SubBay, decimalLatitude = Latitude, decimalLongitude = Longitude, sampleSizeValue = surface_area_num, eventDate = CompDate) 2.1.3 Occurrence file The next file we need to create is the Occurrence file. This file includes all the information about the species that were observed. An occurrence in Darwin Core is the intersection of an organism at a time and a place. We have already done the work to identify the time and place in the event file so we don’t need to do that again here. What we do need to is identify all the information about the organisms. Another piece of information that goes in here is basisOfRecord which is a required field and has a controlled vocabulary. For the data we work with you’ll usually put HumanObservation or MachineObservation. If it’s eDNA data you’ll use MaterialSample. If your data are part of a museum collection you’ll use PreservedSpecimen. Important to note that there is overlap in the Darwin Core terms that “allowed” to be in the event file and in the occurrence file. This is because data can be submitted as “Occurrence Only” where you don’t have a separate event file. In that case, the location and date information will need to be included in the occurrence file. Since we are formatting this dataset as a sampling event we will not include location and date information in the occurrence file. To see all the Darwin Core terms that can go in the occurrence file go here https://tools.gbif.org/dwca-validator/extension.do?id=dwc:occurrence. This dataset in its original format is in “wide format”. All that means is that data that we would expect to be encoded as values in the rows are instead column headers. We have to pull all the scientific names out of the column headers and turn them into actual values in the data. occurrence &lt;- melt(BagSeine, id=1:47, measure=48:109, variable.name=&quot;vernacularName&quot;, value.name=&quot;relativeAbundance&quot;) You’ll notice when we did that step we went from 5481 obs (or rows) in the data to 334341 obs. We went from wide to long. dim(BagSeine) [1] 5481 109 dim(occurrence) [1] 334341 49 Now as with the event file we have several pieces of information that need to be added or changed to make sure the data are following Darwin Core. We always want to include as much information as possible to make the data as reusable as possible. occurrence &lt;- occurrence %&gt;% mutate(vernacularName = gsub(&quot;\\\\.&quot;,&#39; &#39;, vernacularName), eventID = paste(&quot;Station&quot;, station_code, &quot;Date&quot;, completion_dttm, sep = &quot;_&quot;), occurrenceStatus = ifelse(relativeAbundance == 0, &quot;Absent&quot;, &quot;Present&quot;), basisOfRecord = &quot;HumanObservation&quot;, organismQuantityType = &quot;Relative Abundance&quot;, collectionCode = paste(Bay, Gear_Type, sep = &quot; &quot;)) We will match the taxa list with our occurrence file data to bring in the taxonomic information that we pulled from WoRMS. To save time you’ll just import the processed taxa list which includes the taxonomic hierarchy and the required term scientificNameID which is one of the most important pieces of information to include for OBIS. taxaList &lt;- read.csv(&quot;https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/53a887f4e4b075096c60cfdd?f=__disk__49%2F0a%2F73%2F490a7337fa94039715809496b22f5d003b8a79a2&amp;allowOpen=true&quot;, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) ## Merge taxaList with occurrence occurrence &lt;- merge(occurrence, taxaList, by = &quot;vernacularName&quot;, all.x = T) ## Test that all the vernacularNames found a match in taxaList_updated Hmisc::describe(occurrence$scientificNameID) n missing distinct 334341 0 61 lowest : urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:105792 urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:107034 urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:107379 urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:126983 urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:127089 highest: urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:367528 urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:396707 urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:421784 urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:422069 urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:443955 For that last line of code we are expecting to see no missing values for scientificNameID. Every row in the file should have a value in scientificNameID which should be a WoRMS LSID that look like this urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:144531 We need to create a unique ID for each row in the occurrence file. This is known as the occurrenceID and is a required term. The occurrenceID needs to be globally unique and needs to be permanent and kept in place if any updates to the dataset are made. You should not create brand new occurrenceIDs when you update a dataset. To facilitate this I like to build the occurrenceID from pieces of information available in the dataset to create a unique ID for each row in the occurrence file. For this dataset I used the eventID (Station + Date) plus the scientific name. This only works if there is only one scientific name per station per date so if you have different ages or sexes of species at the same station and date this method of creating the occurrenceID won’t work for you. occurrence$occurrenceID &lt;- paste(occurrence$eventID, gsub(&quot; &quot;, &quot;_&quot;,occurrence$scientificName), sep = &quot;_&quot;) occurrence[1,]$occurrenceID [1] &quot;Station_95_Date_09JAN1997:14:35:00.000_Atractosteus_spatula&quot; For the occurrence file we only have one column to rename. We could have avoided this step if we had named it organismQuantity up above but I kept this to remind me what the data providers had called this. occurrence &lt;- occurrence %&gt;% rename(organismQuantity = relativeAbundance) 2.1.4 Extended Measurement or Fact extension file The final file we are going to create is the Extended Measurement or Fact extension (emof). This is a bit like a catch all for any measurements or facts that are not captured in Darwin Core. Darwin Core does not have terms for things like temperature, salinity, gear type, cruise number, length, weight, etc. We are going to create a long format file where each of these is a set of rows in the extended measurement or fact file. You can find all the terms in this extension here https://tools.gbif.org/dwca-validator/extension.do?id=http://rs.iobis.org/obis/terms/ExtendedMeasurementOrFact. OBIS uses the BODC NERC Vocabulary Server to provide explicit definitions for each of the measurements https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/search_nvs/. For this dataset I was only able to find code definitions provided by the data providers for some of the measurements. I included the ones that I was able to find code definitions and left out any that I couldn’t find those for. The ones I was able to find code definitions for were Total.Of.Samples_Count, gear_size, start_wind_speed_num, start_barometric_pressure_num, start_temperature_num, start_salinity_num, start_dissolved_oxygen_num. All the others I left out. totalOfSamples &lt;- event[c(&quot;Total.Of.Samples_Count&quot;, &quot;eventID&quot;)] totalOfSamples &lt;-

Salmon Ocean Ecology Data 2.2.1 Intro One of the goals of the Hakai Institute and the Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System (CIOOS) is to facilitate Open Science and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) ecological and oceanographic data. In a concerted effort to adopt or establish how best to do that, several Hakai and CIOOS staff attended an International Ocean Observing System (IOOS) Code Sprint in Ann Arbour, Michigan between October 7–11, 2019, to discuss how to implement FAIR data principles for biological data collected in the marine environment. The Darwin Core is a highly structured data format that standardizes data table relations, vocabularies, and defines field names. The Darwin Core defines three table types: event, occurrence, and measurementOrFact. This intuitively captures the way most ecologists conduct their research. Typically, a survey (event) is conducted and measurements, counts, or observations (collectively measurementOrFacts) are made regarding a specific habitat or species (occurrence). In the following script I demonstrate how I go about converting a subset of the data collected from the Hakai Institute Juvenile Salmon Program and discuss challenges, solutions, pros and cons, and when and what’s worthwhile to convert to Darwin Core. The conversion of a dataset to Darwin Core is much easier if your data are already tidy (normalized) in which you represent your data in separate tables that reflect the hierarchical and related nature of your observations. If your data are not already in a consistent and structured format, the conversion would likely be very arduos and not intuitive. 2.2.2 event The first step is to consider what you will define as an event in your data set. I defined the capture of fish using a purse seine net as the event. Therefore, each row in the event table is one deployment of a seine net and is assigned a unique eventID. My process for conversion was to make a new table called event and map the standard Darwin Core column names to pre-existing columns that serve the same purpose in my original seine_data table and populate the other required fields. event &lt;- tibble(eventID = survey_seines$seine_id, eventDate = date(survey_seines$survey_date), decimalLatitude = survey_seines$lat, decimalLongitude = survey_seines$long, geodeticDatum = &quot;EPSG:4326 WGS84&quot;, minimumDepthInMeters = 0, maximumDepthInMeters = 9, # seine depth is 9 m samplingProtocol = &quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.21966/1.566666&quot; # This is the DOI for the Hakai Salmon Data Package that contains the smnpling protocol, as well as the complete data package ) write_csv(event, here::here(&quot;datasets&quot;, &quot;hakai_salmon_data&quot;, &quot;event.csv&quot;)) 2.2.3 occurrence Next you’ll want to determine what constitutes an occurrence for your data set. Because each event caputers fish, I consider each fish to be an occurrence. Therefore, the unit of observation (each row) in the occurrence table is a fish. To link each occurence to an event you need to include the eventID column for every occurrence so that you know what seine (event) each fish (occurrence) came from. You must also provide a globally unique identifier for each occurrence. I already have a locally unique identifier for each fish in the original fish_data table called ufn. To make it globally unique I pre-pend the organization and research program metadata to the ufn column. #TODO: Include bycatch data as well ## make table long first seines_total_long &lt;- survey_seines %&gt;% select(seine_id, so_total, pi_total, cu_total, co_total, he_total, ck_total) %&gt;% pivot_longer(-seine_id, names_to = &quot;scientificName&quot;, values_to = &quot;n&quot;) seines_total_long$scientificName &lt;- recode(seines_total_long$scientificName, so_total = &quot;Oncorhynchus nerka&quot;, pi_total = &quot;Oncorhynchus gorbushca&quot;, cu_total = &quot;Oncorhynchus keta&quot;, co_total = &quot;Oncorhynchus kisutch&quot;, ck_total = &quot;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha&quot;, he_total = &quot;Clupea pallasii&quot;) seines_taken_long &lt;- survey_seines %&gt;% select(seine_id, so_taken, pi_taken, cu_taken, co_taken, he_taken, ck_taken) %&gt;% pivot_longer(-seine_id, names_to = &quot;scientificName&quot;, values_to = &quot;n_taken&quot;) seines_taken_long$scientificName &lt;- recode(seines_taken_long$scientificName, so_taken = &quot;Oncorhynchus nerka&quot;, pi_taken = &quot;Oncorhynchus gorbushca&quot;, cu_taken = &quot;Oncorhynchus keta&quot;, co_taken = &quot;Oncorhynchus kisutch&quot;, ck_taken = &quot;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha&quot;, he_taken = &quot;Clupea pallasii&quot;) ## remove records that have already been assigned an ID seines_long &lt;- full_join(seines_total_long, seines_taken_long, by = c(&quot;seine_id&quot;, &quot;scientificName&quot;)) %&gt;% drop_na() %&gt;% mutate(n_not_taken = n - n_taken) %&gt;% #so_total includes the number taken so I subtract n_taken to get n_not_taken select(-n_taken, -n) %&gt;% filter(n_not_taken &gt; 0) all_fish_caught &lt;- seines_long[rep(seq.int(1, nrow(seines_long)), seines_long$n_not_taken), 1:3] %&gt;% select(-n_not_taken) %&gt;% mutate(prefix = &quot;hakai-jsp-&quot;, suffix = 1:nrow(.), occurrenceID = paste0(prefix, suffix) ) %&gt;% select(-prefix, -suffix) # # Change species names to full Scientific names latin &lt;- fct_recode(fish_data$species, &quot;Oncorhynchus nerka&quot; = &quot;SO&quot;, &quot;Oncorhynchus gorbuscha&quot; = &quot;PI&quot;, &quot;Oncorhynchus keta&quot; = &quot;CU&quot;, &quot;Oncorhynchus kisutch&quot; = &quot;CO&quot;, &quot;Clupea pallasii&quot; = &quot;HE&quot;, &quot;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha&quot; = &quot;CK&quot;) %&gt;% as.character() fish_retained_data &lt;- fish_data %&gt;% mutate(scientificName = latin) %&gt;% select(-species) %&gt;% mutate(prefix = &quot;hakai-jsp-&quot;, occurrenceID = paste0(prefix, ufn)) %&gt;% select(-semsp_id, -prefix, -ufn, -fork_length_field, -fork_length, -weight, -weight_field) occurrence &lt;- bind_rows(all_fish_caught, fish_retained_data) %&gt;% mutate(basisOfRecord = &quot;HumanObservation&quot;, occurenceStatus = &quot;present&quot;) %&gt;% rename(eventID = seine_id) For each occuerence of the six different fish species that I caught I need to match the species name that I provide with the official scientificName that is part of the World Register of Marine Species database http://www.marinespecies.org/ # I went directly to the WoRMS webite (http://www.marinespecies.org/) to download the full taxonomic levels for the salmon species I have and put the WoRMS output (species_matched.xls) table in this project directory which is read in below and joined with the occurrence table species_matched &lt;- readxl::read_excel(here::here(&quot;datasets&quot;, &quot;hakai_salmon_data&quot;, &quot;raw_data&quot;, &quot;species_matched.xls&quot;)) occurrence &lt;- left_join(occurrence, species_matched, by = c(&quot;scientificName&quot; = &quot;ScientificName&quot;)) %&gt;% select(occurrenceID, basisOfRecord, scientificName, eventID, occurrenceStatus = occurenceStatus, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species) write_csv(occurrence, here::here(&quot;datasets&quot;, &quot;hakai_salmon_data&quot;, &quot;occurrence.csv&quot;)) 2.2.4 measurementOrFact To convert all your measurements or facts from your normal format to Darwin Core you essentially need to put all your measurements into one column called measurementType and a corresponding column called MeasurementValue. This standardizes the column names are in the measurementOrFact table. There are a number of predefined measurementTypes listed on the NERC database that should be used where possible. I found it difficult to navigate this page to find the correct measurementType. Here I convert length, and weight measurements that relate to an event and an occurrence and call those measurementTypes as length and weight. fish_data$weight &lt;- coalesce(fish_data$weight, fish_data$weight_field) fish_data$fork_length &lt;- coalesce(fish_data$fork_length, fish_data$fork_length_field) fish_length &lt;- fish_data %&gt;% mutate(occurrenceID = paste0(&quot;hakai-jsp-&quot;, ufn)) %&gt;% select(occurrenceID, eventID = seine_id, fork_length, weight) %&gt;% mutate(measurementType = &quot;fork length&quot;, measurementValue = fork_length) %&gt;% select(eventID, occurrenceID, measurementType, measurementValue) %&gt;% mutate(measurementUnit = &quot;millimeters&quot;, measurementUnitID = &quot;http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P06/current/UXMM/&quot;) fish_weight &lt;- fish_data %&gt;% mutate(occurrenceID = paste0(&quot;hakai-jsp-&quot;, ufn)) %&gt;% select(occurrenceID, eventID = seine_id, fork_length, weight) %&gt;% mutate(measurementType = &quot;mass&quot;, measurementValue = weight) %&gt;% select(eventID, occurrenceID, measurementType, measurementValue) %&gt;% mutate(measurementUnit = &quot;grams&quot;, measurementUnitID = &quot;http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P06/current/UGRM/&quot;) measurementOrFact &lt;- bind_rows(fish_length, fish_weight) %&gt;% drop_na(measurementValue) rm(fish_length, fish_weight) write_csv(measurementOrFact, here::here(&quot;datasets&quot;, &quot;hakai_salmon_data&quot;, &quot;measurementOrFact.csv&quot;)) 2.3 Hakai Seagrass 2.3.1 Setup This section clears the workspace, checks the working directory, and installs packages (if required) and loads packages, and loads necessary datasets library(&quot;knitr&quot;) # Knitr global chunk options opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE) 2.3.1.1 Load Data First load the seagrass density survey data, set variable classes, and have a quick look # Load density data seagrassDensity &lt;- read.csv(&quot;raw_data/seagrass_density_survey.csv&quot;, colClass = &quot;character&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(date = ymd(date), depth = as.numeric(depth), transect_dist = factor(transect_dist), collected_start = ymd_hms(collected_start), collected_end = ymd_hms(collected_end), density = as.numeric(density), density_msq = as.numeric(density_msq), canopy_height_cm = as.numeric(canopy_height_cm), flowering_shoots = as.numeric(flowering_shoots)) %T&gt;% glimpse() ## Rows: 3,031 ## Columns: 22 ## $ X &lt;chr&gt;

The seagrass density surveys collect data at discrete points (ie. 5 metres) along the transects, while the habitat surveys collect data over sections (ie. 0 - 5 metres) along the transects. In order to fit these two surveys together, we’ll narrow the habitat surveys from a range to a point so the locations will match. Based on how the habitat data is collected, the point the habitat survey is applied to will be the distance at the end of the swath (ie. 10-15m will become 15m). To account for no preceeding distance, the 0m distance will use the 0-5m section of the survey. First, well make the necessary transformations to the habitat dataset. # Reformat seagrassHabitat to merge with seagrassDensity ## replicate 0 - 5m transect dist to match with 0m in density survey; ## rest of habitat bins can map one to one with density (ie. 5 - 10m -&gt;

Of special concern here are datasets that include both a total (species-specific) catch weight, in addition to individual measurements (for a subset of the overall data). In this case, through our standardization to Darwin Core, we want to ensure that data users understand that the individual measurements are a part of, or subset of, the overall (species-specific) record, whilst at the same time ensure that data providers are not duplicating occurrence records to OBIS. The GitHub issue related to application is can be found here 2.4.1 Workflow Overview In our current setup, this relationship between the overall catch data and subsetted information is provided in the resourceRelationship extension. This extension cannot currently be harvested by GBIF. The required terms for this extension are resourceID, relatedResourceID, resourceRelationshipID and relationshipOfResource. The relatedResourceID here refers to the object of the relationship, whereas the resourceID refers to the subject of the relationship: resourceRelationshipID: a unique identifier for the relationship between one resource (the subject) and another (relatedResource, object). resourceID: a unique identifier for the resource that is the subject of the relationship. relatedResourceID: a unique identifier for the resource that is the object of the relationship. relationshipOfResource: The relationship of the subject (identified by the resourceID) to the object (relatedResourceID). The relationshipOfResource is a free text field. A few resources have been published to OBIS that contain the resourceRelationship extension (examples). Here, I’ll lay out the process and coding used for the Trawl Catch and Species Abundance from the 2019 Gulf of Alaska International Year of the Salmon Expedition. In the following code chunks some details are omitted to improve the readability - the overall code to standardize the catch data can be found here. This dataset includes species-specific total catch data at multiple stations (sampling events). From each catch, individual measurements were also taken. Depending on the number of individual caught in the trawl, this was either the total number of species individuals caught, or only a subset (in case of large numbers of individuals caught). In this specific data record, we created a single Event Core with three extensions: an occurrence extension, measurement or fact extension, and the resourceRelationship extension. However, in this walk-through I’ll only touch on the Event Core, occurrence extension and resourceRelationship extension. The trawl data is part of a larger project collecting various data types related to salmon ocean ecology. Therefore, in our Event Core we nested information related to the sampling event in the specific layer. (include a visual representation of the schema). Prior to creating the Event Core, we ensured that e.g. dates and times followed the correct ISO-8601 standards, and converted to the correct time zone. # Time is recorded numerically (1037 instead of 10:37), so need to change these columns: trawl2019$END_DEPLOYMENT_TIME &lt;- substr(as.POSIXct(sprintf(&quot;%04.0f&quot;, trawl2019$END_DEPLOYMENT_TIME), format = &quot;%H%M&quot;), 12, 16) trawl2019$BEGIN_RETRIEVAL_TIME &lt;- substr(as.POSIXct(sprintf(&quot;%04.0f&quot;, trawl2019$BEGIN_RETRIEVAL_TIME), format = &quot;%H%M&quot;), 12, 16) # Additionally, the vessel time is recorded in &#39;Vladivostok&#39; according to the metadata tab. This has to be converted to UTC. trawl2019 &lt;- trawl2019 %&gt;% mutate(eventDate_start = format_iso_8601(as.POSIXct(paste(EVENT_DATE_START, END_DEPLOYMENT_TIME), tz = &quot;Asia/Vladivostok&quot;)), eventDate_start = str_replace(eventDate_start, &quot;\\\\+00:00&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;), eventDate_finish = format_iso_8601(as.POSIXct(paste(EVENT_DATE_FINISH, BEGIN_RETRIEVAL_TIME), tz = &quot;Asia/Vladivostok&quot;)), eventDate_finish = str_replace(eventDate_finish, &quot;\\\\+00:00&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;), eventDate = paste(eventDate_start, eventDate_finish, sep = &quot;/&quot;), project = &quot;IYS&quot;, cruise = paste(project, &quot;GoA2019&quot;, sep = &quot;:&quot;), station = paste(cruise, TOW_NUMBER, sep=&quot;:Stn&quot;), trawl = paste(station, &quot;trawl&quot;, sep=&quot;:&quot;)) Then we created the various layers of our Event Core. We created these layers/data frames from two separate datasets that data are pulled from - one dataset that contains the overall catch data, and one dataset that contains the specimen data: trawl2019_allCatch &lt;- read_excel(here(&quot;Trawl&quot;, &quot;2019&quot;, &quot;raw_data&quot;, &quot;2019_GoA_Fish_Trawl_catchdata.xlsx&quot;), sheet = &quot;CATCH_FINAL&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(project = &quot;IYS&quot;, cruise = paste(project, &quot;GoA2019&quot;, sep = &quot;:&quot;), station = paste(cruise, `TOW_NUMBER (number)`, sep = &quot;:Stn&quot;), trawl = paste(station, &quot;trawl&quot;, sep = &quot;:&quot;)) trawl2019_specimen &lt;- read_excel(here(&quot;Trawl&quot;, &quot;2019&quot;, &quot;raw_data&quot;, &quot;2019_GoA_Fish_Specimen_data.xlsx&quot;), sheet = &quot;SPECIMEN_FINAL&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(project = &quot;IYS&quot;, cruise = paste(project, &quot;GoA2019&quot;, sep = &quot;:&quot;), station = paste(cruise, TOW_NUMBER, sep = &quot;:Stn&quot;), trawl = paste(station, &quot;trawl&quot;, sep = &quot;:&quot;), sample = paste(trawl, &quot;sample&quot;, sep = &quot;:&quot;), sample = paste(sample, row_number(), sep = &quot;&quot;)) Next we created the Event Core, ensuring that we connect the data to the right layer (i.e. date and time should be connected to the layer associated with the sampling event). Please note that because we are creating multiple layers and nesting information, and then at a later stage combining different tables, this results in cells being populated with NA. These have to be removed prior to publishing the Event Core through the IPT. trawl2019_project &lt;- trawl2019 %&gt;% select(eventID = project) %&gt;% distinct(eventID) %&gt;% mutate(type = &quot;project&quot;) trawl2019_cruise &lt;- trawl2019 %&gt;% select(eventID = cruise, parentEventID = project) %&gt;% distinct(eventID, .keep_all = TRUE) %&gt;% mutate(type = &quot;cruise&quot;) trawl2019_station &lt;- trawl2019 %&gt;% select(eventID = station, parentEventID = cruise) %&gt;% distinct(eventID, .keep_all = TRUE) %&gt;% mutate(type = &quot;station&quot;) # The coordinates associated to the trawl need to be presented in a LINESTRING. # END_LONGITUDE_DD needs to be inverted (has to be between -180 and 180, inclusive). trawl2019_coordinates &lt;- trawl2019 %&gt;% select(eventID = trawl, START_LATITUDE_DD, longitude, END_LATITUDE_DD, END_LONGITUDE_DD) %&gt;% mutate(END_LONGITUDE_DD = END_LONGITUDE_DD * -1, footprintWKT = paste(&quot;LINESTRING (&quot;, longitude, START_LATITUDE_DD, &quot;,&quot;, END_LONGITUDE_DD, END_LATITUDE_DD, &quot;)&quot;)) trawl2019_linestring &lt;- obistools::calculate_centroid(trawl2019_coordinates$footprintWKT) trawl2019_linestring &lt;- cbind(trawl2019_coordinates, trawl2019_linestring) %&gt;% select(eventID, footprintWKT, decimalLatitude, decimalLongitude, coordinateUncertaintyInMeters) trawl2019_trawl &lt;- trawl2019 %&gt;% select(eventID = trawl, parentEventID = station, eventDate, year, month, day) %&gt;% mutate(minimumDepthInMeters = 0, # headrope was at the surface maximumDepthInMeters = trawl2019$MOUTH_OPENING_HEIGHT, samplingProtocol = &quot;midwater trawl&quot;, # when available add DOI to paper here locality = case_when( trawl2019$EVENT_SUB_TYPE == &quot;Can EEZ&quot; ~ &quot;Canadian EEZ&quot;), locationID = case_when( trawl2019$EVENT_SUB_TYPE == &quot;Can EEZ&quot; ~ &quot;http://marineregions.org/mrgid/8493&quot;)) %&gt;% left_join(trawl2019_linestring, by = &quot;eventID&quot;) %&gt;% distinct(eventID, .keep_all = TRUE) %&gt;% mutate(type = &quot;midwater trawl&quot;) trawl2019_sample &lt;- trawl2019_specimen %&gt;% select(eventID = sample, parentEventID = trawl) %&gt;% distinct(eventID, .keep_all = TRUE) %&gt;% mutate(type = &quot;individual sample&quot;) trawl2019_event &lt;- bind_rows(trawl2019_project, trawl2019_cruise, trawl2019_station, trawl2019_trawl, trawl2019_sample) # Remove NAs from the Event Core: trawl2019_event &lt;- sapply(trawl2019_event, as.character) trawl2019_event[is.na(trawl2019_event)] &lt;- &quot;&quot; trawl2019_event &lt;- as.data.frame(trawl2019_event) TO DO: Add visual of e.g. the top 10 rows of the Event Core. Now that we created the Event Core, we create the occurrence extension. To do this, we create two separate occurrence data tables: one that includes the occurrence data for the total catch, and one data table for the specimen data. Finally, the Occurrence extension is created by combining these two data frames. Personally, I prefer to re-order it so it makes visual sense to me (nest the specimen occurrence records under their respective overall catch data). trawl2019_allCatch_worms &lt;- worrms::wm_records_names(unique(trawl2019_allCatch$scientificname)) trawl2019_occ &lt;- left_join(trawl2019_allCatch, trawl2019_allCatch_worms, by = &quot;scientificname&quot;) %&gt;% rename(eventID = trawl, specificEpithet = species, scientificNameAuthorship = authority, taxonomicStatus = status, taxonRank = rank, scientificName = scientificname, scientificNameID = lsid, individualCount = `CATCH_COUNT (pieces)(**includes Russian expansion for some species)`, occurrenceRemarks = COMMENTS) %&gt;% mutate(occurrenceID = paste(eventID, &quot;occ&quot;, sep = &quot;:&quot;), occurrenceID = paste(occurrenceID, row_number(), sep = &quot;:&quot;), occurrenceStatus = &quot;present&quot;, sex = &quot;&quot;) trawl2019_catch_ind_worms &lt;- worrms::wm_records_names(unique(trawl2019_catch_ind$scientificname)) %&gt;% bind_rows() trawl2019_catch_ind_occ &lt;- left_join(trawl2019_catch_ind, trawl2019_catch_ind_worms, by = &quot;scientificname&quot;) %&gt;% rename(scientificNameAuthorship = authority, taxonomicStatus = status, taxonRank = rank, scientificName = scientificname, scientificNameID = lsid) %&gt;% mutate(occurrenceID = paste(eventID, &quot;occ&quot;, sep = &quot;:&quot;), occurrenceStatus = &quot;present&quot;, individualCount = 1) # Combine the two occurrence data frames: trawl2019_occ_ext &lt;- dplyr::bind_rows(trawl2019_occ_fnl, trawl2019_catch_ind_fnl) # To re-order the occurrenceID, use following code: order &lt;- stringr::str_sort(trawl2019_occ_ext$occurrenceID, numeric=TRUE) trawl2019_occ_ext &lt;- trawl2019_occ_ext[match(order, trawl2019_occ_ext$occurrenceID),] %&gt;% mutate(basisOfRecord = &quot;HumanObservation&quot;) TO DO: Add visual of e.g. the top 10 rows of the Occurrence extension. Please note that in the overall species-specific occurrence data frame, individualCount was not included. This term should not be used for abundance studies, but to avoid confusion and the appearance that the specimen records are an additional observation on top of the overall catch record, the individualCount term was left blank for the overall catch data. A resource relationship extension is created to further highlight that the individual samples in the occurrence extension are part of a larger overall catch that was also listed in the occurrence extension. In this extension, we wanted to make sure to highlight that the specimen occurrence records are a subset of the overall catch data through the field relationshipOfResource1. Each of these relationships gets a unique resourceRelationshipID. trawl_resourceRelationship &lt;- trawl2019_occ_ext %&gt;% select(eventID, occurrenceID, scientificName) %&gt;% mutate(resourceID = ifelse(grepl(&quot;sample&quot;, trawl2019_occ_ext$occurrenceID), trawl2019_occ_ext$occurrenceID, NA)) %&gt;% mutate(eventID = gsub(&quot;:sample.*&quot;, &quot;&quot;, trawl2019_occ_ext$eventID)) %&gt;% group_by(eventID, scientificName) %&gt;% filter(n() != 1) %&gt;% ungroup() trawl_resourceRelationship &lt;- trawl_resourceRelationship %&gt;% mutate(relatedResourceID = ifelse(grepl(&quot;sample&quot;, trawl_resourceRelationship$occurrenceID), NA, trawl_resourceRelationship$occurrenceID)) %&gt;% mutate(relationshipOfResource = ifelse(!is.na(resourceID), &quot;is a subset of&quot;, NA)) %&gt;% dplyr::arrange(eventID, scientificName) %&gt;% fill(relatedResourceID) %&gt;% filter(!is.na(resourceID)) order &lt;- stringr::str_sort(trawl_resourceRelationship$resourceID, numeric = TRUE) trawl_resourceRelationship &lt;- trawl_resourceRelationship[match(order, trawl_resourceRelationship$resourceID),] trawl_resourceRelationship &lt;- trawl_resourceRelationship %&gt;% mutate(resourceRelationshipID = paste(relatedResourceID, &quot;rr&quot;, sep = &quot;:&quot;), ID = sprintf(&quot;%03d&quot;, row_number()), resourceRelationshipID = paste(resourceRelationshipID, ID, sep = &quot;:&quot;)) %&gt;% select(eventID, resourceRelationshipID, resourceID, relationshipOfResource, relatedResourceID) TO DO: Add visual of e.g. the top 10 rows of the ResourceRelationship extension. 2.4.2 FAQ Q1. Why not use the terms associatedOccurrence or associatedTaxa? A. There seems to be a movement away from the term associatedOccurrence as the resourceRelationship extension has a much broader use case. Some issues that were raised on GitHub exemplify this, see e.g. here. associatedTaxa is used to provide identifiers or names of taxa and the associations of an Occurrence with them. This term is not apt for establishing relationships between taxa, only between specific Occurrences of an organism with other taxa. As noted on the TDWG website, […] Note that the ResourceRelationship class is an alternative means of representing associations, and with more detail. See also e.g. this issue. "],["dealing-with-errors.html", "Chapter 3 Dealing with errors 3.1 Example using GitHub to resolve errors", " Chapter 3 Dealing with errors Datasets can have a wide variety of errors that pop up during the darwin core alignment process. This chapter details ways in which a data manager can identify, discuss, and resolve potential errors in the data. It should be noted that, in most cases, the data manager/scientist aligning the data to darwin core should reach out to the data originator to ensure the actions taken are not incorrectly representing the observations. 3.1 Example using GitHub to resolve errors Dataset sent to OBIS-USA via email. OBIS-USA uploaded to IPT. Once the data were uploaded, the IPT identified there was an issue with the occurrenceID field. The issue was then presented and discussed in a GitHub ticket: The data manager uploaded the raw data and code to GitHub through the pull request below. This included a fix for the occurrenceID issue. The OBIS node manager was notified of the availability of a revised dataset by pointing directly to the appropriate commit in GitHub: The OBIS node manager downloaded the data from the commit above and uploaded them to the IPT. The IPT returned a summary of the dataset including that 434 records had invalid scientificNameID records in the occurrence file. After some data sleuthing, the data manager noticed that the code accidentally removed trailing zeros from scientificNameID that ended in 0: So, the data manager updated the code to resolve the issue and generate a new occurrence file. Here is fixing the scientificNameID generation: Here is removing the problematic code: The revised occurrence file was then resubmitted to the OBIS node manager by pointing them at the appropriate commit record: The OBIS node manager downloaded the data from the commit above and uploaded them to the IPT.

What data structure does OBIS recommend? A. The OBIS-ENV Darwin Core Archive Data Structure. OBIS manual Q. What is a controlled vocabulary, why use them? A. There are a number of controlled vocabularies that are used to describe parameters commonly used in specific research domains. Using terms defined in a controlled vocabulary allows for greater interoperability of data sets within the domain, and ideally between domains by ensuring that variables that are the same can be identified. Q. What controlled vocabularies does OBIS rely on? A.

How can I find out which common measurementTypes are used in measurement or facts tables in existing OBIS datasets? A. See Measurement Types in OBIS Q. What is an ontology? A. An ontology is a classification system for establishing a hierarchically related set of concepts. Concepts are often terms from controlled vocabularies. Ontologies can include all of the following, but are not required to include them. Classes (general things, types of things) Instances (individual things) Relationships among things Properties of things Functions, processes, constraints, and rules relating to things Q. What is ERDDAP? A. ERDDAP is a data server. It provides ‘easier access to scientific data’ by providing a consistent interface that aggregates many disparate data sources. It does this by providing translation services between many common file types for gridded arrarys (‘net CDF’ files) and tabular data (spreadsheets). Data access is also made easier because it unifies different types of data servers and access protocols. Q. What metadata profile does OBIS use? A. OBIS uses the GBIF EML profile (version 1.1) Q.

"],["references.html", "References", " References "],["extras.html", "Chapter 6 Extras 6.1 Ecological Metadata Language (EML)", " Chapter 6 Extras Below is some more in-depth information into specific areas associated with standardizing your data to Darwin Core and uploading it through the IPT. 6.1 Ecological Metadata Language (EML) The Ecological Metadata Language (EML) is a community developed and maintained metadata standard that is typically associated with ecological-, and earth and environmental data. The purpose of EML is to provide the ecological community with an extensible, flexible, metadata standard used in data analysis and archiving, which will allow automated machine processing, searching and retrieval. EML has been around since 2003, and can be considered a “dialect” or specification to XML to describe tables and other data objects. The XML Schema provides a framework for the metadata, with defined “rules” on how to organize the metadata without any stipulations (another way to put it, XML is the language that defines the rules that govern the EML syntax). The XML Schema defines the structure of some information in a document (e.g. elements and attributes names and relationships), but does not provide any specific details the information included within. An EML document or file (eml.xml) is used to provide detailed description of metadata related to data objects, including tables (and other data objects), their columns, typing etc, and how data tables are linked or grouped. EML is widely used for datasets about ecosystem level observations, and can be used to detail data table information to a high granularity, which allows data users to arrange data tables in any way they need to. EML is particularly useful for wide data tables as table level details are entirely contained within the metadata document, meaning that there is not necessarily a need for external definitions such as a code list. However, if you have a long table arrangement, like the Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A), you can define the allowable values for the column in the metadata as well. EML is excellent at describing the details of a column of data so that the data values in the tables can be read into analysis systems or an analysis environment using the metadata, or even into a relational database. EML allows for tables to be easily reusable, and read into workflows, translated or reformatted. A drawback to EML is that, compared to the ISO standard, EML is a community standard, adopting a more ‘bottom-up’ approach. This is contrary to the ISO standard, which are internationally agreed upon standards by experts (‘top-down’). However, at the time of EML development in the early 2000’s there was a gap in metadata options to describe ecological data tables, with ISO standards typically being more applicable to geographic data. EML can cover almost anything and is particularly good at tabular data. But at the same time, due to the self-contained nature, there can be little control from outside lists, which means that the description is left to the EML constructor (data provider/manager) and consequently, individual datasets can look quite different from each other, even when they contain similar measurements. As such, it will be important to document best practices and clear mapping of fields between different metadata schemas (e.g. cross-walks between ISO.xml and EML.xml). As of version 2.2, EML can link to external ontologies, and there is capacity for annotation with external terms (e.g. through their URIs). Code lists and external dictionaries can help as they sometimes contain additional information that might not fit into EML (e.g. protocols, or code lists stored in ontologies). Having these external code lists and exporting them as EML snippets could go a long way in reducing that heterogeneity, because the constructors can then select measurements from lists when developing EML documents. EML is implemented as a series of XML document types (modules) that can be used in an extensible manner to document ecological data. Each EML module is designed to describe one logical part of the total metadata that should be included with any ecological dataset. The architecture of EML was designed to serve the needs of the ecological community, and has benefitted from previous work in other related metadata standards. Using this format can facilitate future growth of the metadata language, and EML supports an active developer community (see e.g. NCEAS EML GitHub). EML adopts much of its syntax from the other metadata standards that have evolved from the expertise of groups in other disciplines. Whenever possible, EML adopted entire trees of information in order to facilitate conversion of EML documents into other metadata languages. The GBIF IPT is a tool used to create a single eml.xml file format inside the DwC-A data package. However, the IPT does not use any of the EML’s built-in table description modules, and perhaps primarily uses one EML module (resource module) for high-level metadata. However, it is important to know how both OBIS and GBIF use EML, as often a higher granularity of the metadata can be found in the original data tables. An example of this is spatial coverage. The IPT only allows for either a bounding box to be documented (populating North, South, East, and West coordinates), or a single polygon. The EML document however would be able to capture multiple polygons worth of spatial coverage (i.e. a polygon for each transect surveyed). This more detailed information however is often captured in the data (in an OBIS record). Additionally, not all fields that can be populated in an EML document can be translated to the IPT, or harvested by OBIS and GBIF. The GBIF IPT only produces a select number of fields or attributes available in EML. Important: When reading the EML section in the OBIS manual, you’ll notice that it reads that OBIS uses the GBIF EML profile (version 1.1). However, the current EML version is 2.2.0, as per EcoInformatics. This does not mean that these versions are not compatible, rather, it means that the GBIF IPT currently uses a subset of available EML 2.2.0 fields and attributes, the subset of which they have versioned 1.1. If you are interested in creating an EML metadata file, it is possible to upload those into the IPT. There are R packages that can help in developing an EML.xml file. These packages are e.g. EML, emld or EMLassemblyline. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed). You may want to try searching to find the page's new location, or use the table of contents to find the page you are looking for. "]]
