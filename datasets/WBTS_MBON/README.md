This dataset processed by Dylan Pugh during the 2022 Marine BioData Mobilization Workshop.

The raw data is pulled from ERDDAP [here](www.neracoos.org/erddap/tabledap/WBTS_CFIN_2005_2017.csv).

The data is structured as an Event-core dataset using the occurrence and mof extensions.

This data was collected using a mesh-collection method falling under the NERC concept http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/L05/current/22/. 
This concept is listed in the Event file as samplingProtocol, the relevant MoFs (eg mesh size, volume filtered) are then linked to the events.
