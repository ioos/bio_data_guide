**Welcome to the Standardizing Marine Bio Data Working Group's Main Repo!**

* Do you have *Taxonomic Occurrence data* and want to share it?
* Have you ever wanted to chat about *biodata standards*, *programming*, or *biodiversity*?

👋 If so: **This is the place for you**.

-----------------------------------------------------------

There are multiple resources in this GitHub repository, including:

* :notebook: Living documentation for anyone working with, learning about, or conributing to IOOS's best practices for biological data.
* 🗄️ Datasets being actively worked on by community members.
* ♻️ Code and documentation used on other datasets that can be re-used.
* 🧰 Tools to help you navigate the organizational, technical, and social challenges of publishing data.

## 📆 Monthly Meetings
We have open monthly meetings to discuss marine bio data issues. Please join us next time!

* [Link to meeting minutes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JfXHFXhP0rB8juAK3-KvOtqtwDofPwewoAB_ZyFwSwY/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Link to call participation details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JfXHFXhP0rB8juAK3-KvOtqtwDofPwewoAB_ZyFwSwY/edit#bookmark=id.1ksv4uv)

## :question: Have Questions? :question:
* See the "issues" tab above to ask questions or discuss with the IOOS biodata community.
* Also try searching for related issues which are open or have been closed (ie answered).

## Got Data to Share?
* :speech_balloon: open an issue in the issues tab above and tell us about it.
* :floppy_disk: small datasets can be uploaded into `./datasets/` so we can directly help you align with best practices.
* :link: dataset repositories or other hosted data can be included in the links in the `Datasets` section below.

# Datasets
The `./datasets/` directory in this repository contains small datasets which meet one of the following criteria:
* :construction_worker: the community is currently aligning this data
* :notebook: the dataset is retained as an instructive example
* :speak_no_evil: the lazy maintainers of this repo haven't cleaned it out yet 

Ideally each dataset should contain a README.md file with details about the data and the ingestion process for this dataset.
A few datasets are highlighted below as especially instructive examples:

* [example_script_with_fake_data](https://github.com/ioos/bio_data_guide/tree/main/datasets/example_script_with_fake_data) - fake data crafted by Abby Benson to illustrate a very basic conversion to DwC

# The Standardizing Marine Bio Data Guide

See the guide [here](https://ioos.github.io/bio_data_guide/intro.html).

We are documenting, in the form of a :notebook: Guide, relevant resources and standards which apply to various marine biological data sets. 
This is a work in progress, a growing guide that is being put together by scientists and data managers responsible for transforming their data to meet international standards. 
The Guide is exported into multiple formats, including a [pdf](https://github.com/ioos/bio_data_guide/raw/gh-pages/darwin-core-guide.pdf) and an [epub](https://github.com/ioos/bio_data_guide/raw/gh-pages/darwin-core-guide.epub) document. 
Chapters are written in R Markdown files; [contributions are welcome!](https://github.com/ioos/bio_data_guide/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Technical details of how to work with the book can be found in [`/building-the-data-guide.md`](https://github.com/ioos/bio_data_guide/blob/main/building-the-guide.md).

# Historical

This repo started at the 2019 IOOS code sprint.
Original documents from the sprint are retained on a fork of this repo in [marinebon/bio_data_scripts_ioos_workshop_2019](https://github.com/marinebon/bio_data_scripts_ioos_workshop_2019).
